            <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p> My name is Samiksha and I'm a finance professional with a passion for numbers and a love of good food.</p>
  <p>I believe that good food and good financial planning have a lot in common. Both require careful consideration, attention to detail, and a willingness to try new things. And just like a well-prepared meal, a well-prepared financial plan can leave you feeling satisfied and ready for whatever life throws your way.</p>
  <p>When I'm not crunching numbers, you can usually find me at one of Bangalore's many delicious restaurants, like the legendary Bangalore House. I've been known to have a bit of a foodie streak, but I promise it doesn't interfere with my ability to balance a budget or analyze financial reports. In fact, I find that a good meal can often give me the energy I need to tackle even the most complex financial problems.</p>
  <p>I'm a big believer in collaboration and teamwork. After all, two heads are better than one, especially when it comes to navigating the twists and turns of the financial world. And if we're ever stuck on a problem, I'm always happy to brainstorm over a plate of dosas or idlis.</p>
  <p>When I'm not working or eating, you might find me reading up on the latest investment strategies or listening to a stand-up comedy podcast. Hey, just because I take finance seriously doesn't mean I can't have a sense of humor about it.</p>
